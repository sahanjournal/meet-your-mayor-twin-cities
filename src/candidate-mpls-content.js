If we’re not careful, we’ll end up like Detroit, where working-class families were pushed out of their homes, and low-income families became the next unhoused neighbors.

For years now, the Minnesota government has allowed busloads of unhoused individuals from other states to come here places like New York and New Orleans. While we should absolutely take care of our own residents in need, we can’t fix this crisis if other states continue sending their unhoused populations here. Minneapolis cannot solve this problem alone. It’s time we put pressure on those states to stop shifting their responsibilities onto us.",

      "We deserve a city where everyone can afford a safe and stable place to call home. We deserve community safety solutions that are grounded in our shared humanity and responsive to our diverse needs. We deserve a mayor who acts with honesty and integrity. We deserve leadership that will meet the urgency of our climate crisis. We deserve an interconnected and multigenerational city with a vibrant, worker-centered economy and thriving public schools.{newParagraph}I'm running for mayor because Minneapolis is at a moral moment right now. We can either continue down this same path for another four years, or we can make a change.{newParagraph}We have everything we need to solve our most pressing problems as a city – but gridlock and division are making it impossible for our city to get things done. Our current mayor has awarded jobs and contracts based on personal loyalty rather than qualifications. The antagonism between the Mayor and the City Council has created dysfunction, which negatively impacts everyone who lives here.{newParagraph}Under the threat of the Trump administration, it’s more important than ever that our city government can work together. I’m running because we deserve a mayor who can build consensus and trust out of division, one who will govern with integrity. I believe in us – and I know that with the right leadership, we can build the city we deserve together.",
    quote2:
      "Our city’s immigrant neighbors and communities of color deserve a mayor who will center the needs, joys, and successes of their communities, who will invest in their homes, neighborhoods, and businesses, and who will make sure they have the safety and stability they need to thrive. Our communities deserve leadership that will show up in their neighborhoods consistently to support them, not just to curry votes.{newParagraph}Our communities of color and immigrants need safe, stable, and affordable housing. They need protection from state violence from the Trump administration. They need a community safety ecosystem that is focused on responding to their needs and keeping them safe. They need principled leadership that will advocate for them across all forms of government.{newParagraph}From co-chairing the Minnesota Poor People’s Campaign to working with the County to bring HIV care to Black and Brown communities, I’ve spent years building relationships with communities of color and with immigrant communities across the city. I will bring those relationships and that trust into the Mayor’s Office. This isn’t theoretical for me – I’m talking about the neighborhood that my husband and I live in and the people we call neighbors and friends. I will continue to work with the people I’ve stood shoulder to shoulder with in the past 12 years, and I’ll continue to build relationships with those I haven’t worked with yet to advocate for our communities.",
    quote3:
      "The encampments popping up in our city are a reflection of our failure to adequately care for our neighbors. We should be working to prevent and depopulate encampments as quickly as possible by offering support and services, not with bulldozers and police.{newParagraph}Mayor Frey’s go-it-alone approach has left us isolated from important partners in this work. As Mayor, I will build on the relationships I have with the County, the State, and non-profits to coordinate a humane response to this crisis. We need more shelter beds and safe and community-led alternatives to shelter. We also need to support non-profit and public developers in building significantly more deeply affordable housing. With me as Mayor, Minneapolis will be a trusted leader in coordinating and growing the supports and services our unhoused neighbors need.{newParagraph}My administration will work tirelessly to do better by our unhoused neighbors and to offer better, safer options. In a city as prosperous as ours, there’s no reason why anyone’s best option should be sleeping outside. There shouldn’t be encampments in our city because our unhoused neighbors deserve better.",
    quote4:
      "Mayor Frey handled the raid poorly. Even though he was aware of the raid before it happened, he didn’t immediately tell the City Council, leading to significant confusion. He accepted wholesale the explanation for the raid that the Trump administration offered, even as they have consistently lied and deceived to advance their campaign against immigrants. And afterward, he and his team seemed more interested in telling the city how well they handled the situation and blaming our neighbors who showed up to ask questions for causing confusion. The truth is that our mayor has lost the trust of much of our community, and that lack of trust exacerbated an already tense situation.{newParagraph}Minneapolis deserves a mayor who will be transparent with us about federal activity in our city and will work together with our city council in times of crisis. We deserve a mayor who will push his administration, including the police department, to demand transparency from federal agencies and not just accept their explanations for their actions in our city. We deserve a mayor who our neighbors can trust, who will show up in a crisis to offer support and leadership. And we deserve a mayor who will recognize that accountability is a necessary part of leadership, will acknowledge what has gone wrong, and will be proactive in challenging the Trump administration’s actions.{newParagraph}The people of our city have shown time and time again our capacity to care for our immigrant neighbors and our commitment to keeping them safe. Now we need leadership that reflects those values.",

I will work alongside the community to lead this discussion, and I remain committed to creating the spaces needed to have these robust discussions.{newParagraph}As the proud son of Somali immigrants, fighting for immigrant rights has always been the center of my work and mission. As a state senator, I have worked closely with immigrant rights groups and organizations and within my own East African community to author and pass legislation to support and protect immigrants in our state. In particular, I am proud to have authored the Minnesota Northstar Act, which would prohibit local and state law enforcement from using state resources to deport our neighbors. In addition, in my position as the chair of Higher Education, I am worked with students and administrators at the University of Minnesota to make sure that there is no collaboration with ICE and to resist any deportations or civil immigration enforcement on university and college campuses. Everyone in our state deserves to feel safe and welcomed. {newParagraph}As Mayor, I will continue this work by strengthening, upholding and expanding our Minneapolis separation ordinance, and ensuring that no City resources are used to collaborate with ICE. I will also continue to work closely with immigrant rights groups like Unidos MN, COPAL, CTUL and more to inform how the mayor’s office can best direct support immigrants in our city. Finally, I am committed to being a line of defense against President Trump’s attacks on our communities, and will leverage my position to resist attacks on immigrants and communities of color on the municipal level in every way we can.",
    quote3:
      "I will embrace an approach to homelessness that increases funding for shelters and adopts a compassionate approach to encampments, centering public health and human dignity rather than Mayor Frey’s expensive practice of criminalization. Our City is more than capable of accommodating everyone who wants to call it home; combining strong housing policy with dignity for unsheltered residents is the way we do that. We must embrace a Housing First approach — housing ends homelessness; whenever possible, people should be connected directly to housing.",

      "The Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) should not support ICE, whether it’s an immigration raid or not. Regardless of what anyone says about what took place on June 3rd, having been on the ground witnessing events unfold with my own eyes, I know that ICE was present and I saw MPD assist with their actions. This should have never happened, and as Mayor, I would work to strengthen our separation ordinance to make sure it can never happen again and I would hold officers that violate our separation ordinance accountable for their actions. As a hostile Trump administration attacks our communities, local accountability is more important than ever. I am running for Mayor to work towards a city where everyone feels safe and protected. That means standing with our immigrant and undocumented neighbors against attacks from the Federal Government. Our communities deserve reassurance that MPD will not collaborate with ICE and other federal agencies that are intending to strike fear in the hearts of our most marginalized neighbors. Given that we now know that MPD did not violate Minneapolis' current separation ordinance on June 3rd, I am committed to strengthening this policy in order to ensure we are protecting all our neighbors and pushing back against a hostile federal government.",

When there is a drug or other criminal investigation that does not involve immigration enforcement, we should of course work in partnership with federal agencies.

      "Over the last five years, Minneapolis was tested as never before. American cities have faced some of the toughest challenges that we’ve had to confront in generations. But where other cities across the country have struggled and stagnated, Minneapolis has been making a comeback. The challenges we’re facing have not gone away, but our progress is improving people’s lives.{newParagraph}On housing, Minneapolis is leading the nation. While the rest of the country saw rent increase by 31% since 2017. In Minneapolis, we held that increase to just 1%. Now, Minneapolis is producing 8.5 times more deeply affordable housing than before I took office. We also made unprecedented investments in affordable homeownership. And our Stable Homes Stable Schools program has provided stable housing to about 6,000 MPS kids across over 2,000 families.{newParagraph}We’re also making progress on public safety. Police recruitment is up 135%, MPD has more officers today than it has had in years, and the department is the most diverse in our city’s history. And, violent crime is down – in fact, in North Minneapolis, shootings are lower than they’ve been in over 15 years. {newParagraph}Meanwhile, we’re moving forward on police reform. The independent, court-appointed monitor for our consent decree credited Minneapolis with making “more progress toward building a foundation for sustainable reform in the first year of monitoring than nearly any other jurisdiction” in the nation.{newParagraph}Now, I’m running for one more term to bring Minneapolis through to its next brilliant chapter. Let’s do that by building more affordable housing, hiring more police officers to bring down violent crime, accelerating our climate action goals, and delivering exemplary core city services for Minneapolis.",

MPD does not and will not cooperate with ICE or any federal agency in immigration enforcement. I will not compromise our city’s values in protecting our undocumented community, even if we are threatened with a withholding of federal funds. We are proactively suing Donald Trump and his administration, working in conjunction with cities, states, and attorneys general from around the country, and we will not back down.{newParagraph}Our Office of Immigrant & Refugee Affairs helps coordinate services and legal protections for our immigrant communities, and we have developed a taskforce of important stakeholders to get input and disseminate important information. We connect immigrant entrepreneurs to business support and technical assistance to bolster their work and keep cultural corridors strong. Finally, I will also support any additional actions that we can take to supplement our separation ordinance and prevent city employees from being involved in immigration enforcement (including but not limited to ICE) and to protect our immigrant neighbors.",

      "The answer to homelessness is stable housing, not unchecked encampments. And we are providing record amounts of deeply affordable housing so that people experiencing homelessness have the next rung on the ladder to pull themselves out. We are producing 8.5 times the amount of deeply affordable housing since before I took office, without which we would have no ability to place people coming out of homelessness. {newParagraph}We are also one of the only major cities in the country to reduce unsheltered homelessness since the pandemic. In Minneapolis, unsheltered homelessness is down 33% since 2020. Through our Homeless Response Team, we’ve helped more than 270 people transition into stable housing and services just in the last few months — and we’ve seen 911 and 311 calls in neighborhoods that previously had large encampments drop by nearly 80%. Currently, we have no medium or large-scale encampments in Minneapolis. We have to lead with compassion and outreach, offering to connect people living in encampments with housing, addiction treatment, and other social services -- and we will continue to learn and improve how we conduct that outreach and deliver those services. But the truth is that encampments are neither safe nor humane for those who live in them or around them. We have to be willing to close encampments down that have become unsafe, especially when they become targets for human traffickers, violence, and drug traffickers.",

      'Yes, but you don’t have to take my word for it. The city auditor, who does not report to the mayor’s office or to my administration, confirmed that our police department did not violate our separation ordinance. That’s why I was so disappointed when all of my opponents pledged to fire or discipline Chief O’Hara. The audit report confirmed that Lake & Bloomington wasn’t an immigration raid at all, and that MPD was not even aware of the operation, let alone involved in executing it. My leading opponent went on national TV and claimed that our police department broke the law and that I myself ""had MPD collaborate with ICE in targeting our immigrant communities.” In a crisis, mayors have a responsibility to share accurate information, not stoke panic on social media for political gain. There are certainly things we can improve should we face a true immigration raid. But firing or disciplining Chief O’Hara is not the answer.',

The Socialist Workers Party candidates call for a massive public works program to provide employment at union-scale wages building housing. But we need more.
