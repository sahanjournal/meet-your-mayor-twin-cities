      "I am running for mayor because our city is at a standstill. Progress has stalled at most of our major developments, key retailers in our neighborhoods are closing, and city services are stretched to the limit without the necessary investment and support they need. It’s time to get our city moving forward again.",
    quote2:
      "As a refugee to this country, I know firsthand the challenges and struggles of not only living here but attempting to achieve the American Dream. I frequently attend ICE check-ins with members of our community who want the power of a state legislator to assist them. Our elected positions come with great responsibility, and we owe it to our constituents to do everything we can to advocate for their safety and security.{newParagraph}Whether that is the bare minimum of standing with them against ICE’s discrimination or looking at how we can improve the quality of life for the immigrants who work so hard and invest in their small businesses to make our city great.",
    quote3:
      "City Hall has unveiled a comprehensive plan to convert unused office space in downtown to residential housing. While I applaud the creativity, the answer is a little more complicated than that. The fact of the matter is that not every building downtown is suitable for housing. Many were built with hazardous materials that require abatement. Others are simply too old, too complicated, or too dilapidated to convert. We need to thoroughly examine our downtown area to determine which buildings must be demolished to make room for new development. We are living in a different environment than we were before the pandemic, and we need to operate accordingly.",
    quote4:
      "Cyberattacks are an unfortunate reality of modern government. Currently, any government could have a dormant ransomware software sitting on its server, waiting to be activated. We need to build in more redundancies because we can’t always prevent attacks, but we can ensure our city isn’t brought to a halt the way it was, and in some ways still is, after this attack.",
    quote5:
      "The mayor needs to be a welcoming partner to businesses that want to enter these spaces and invest in our city. I’ve heard from too many people that our City Hall is unresponsive at best to their needs when looking to develop. At worst, City Hall has been an active barrier, taking on frivolous lawsuits and defending archaic zoning and permitting processes.{newParagraph}The Midway corridor is one of the most important assets we have as we look to expand our tax base and revitalize areas our immigrant communities depend on. As mayor, I will work with large developers and small, immigrant-owned businesses alike to build relationships and bring investment back to Midway.",
    quote6:
      "Our city’s residents need to know that their government is fighting for them and will protect them from federal overreach. The federal government’s deportation regime is cruel and designed to sow chaos in our immigrant communities. I support the city’s sanctuary policy because we need our workers, neighbors, and family members to be able to live their lives safely.{newParagraph}As mayor, I will look into the limits of the separation ordinance when it comes to joint task forces (where ICE is embedded with the FBI, DEA, or other federal agencies that request the Saint Paul Police Department's cooperation). We should not put our officers in the position of breaking trust with our residents by having them involved in immigration enforcement.",
    quote7:
      "We need to open the door wide for development and let housing providers know that Saint Paul is a place they should do business. Bringing in more people and expanding our tax base is key to offsetting our losses from the federal government. This should’ve been the city's priority over the last few years to avoid landing in this position. But now that we’re here, we need more development, and we need it now.{newParagraph}As a State Legislator, I have strong ties to the state government and will work every lever I can to bring funding back to Saint Paul.",

    quote2:
      "Immigrants should be treated like every other resident in our city—with fairness, dignity, and equal opportunity. To achieve that, we must expand language access across all city services so every resident can fully participate.{newParagraph}Like many low-income residents, immigrant families face barriers to opportunity. That’s why I will work to cut red tape for small entrepreneurs, expand job-training opportunities, and promote pathways to homeownership.{newParagraph}Equally important, I will enforce strong civil-rights protections and ensure bias-free policing with clear accountability. Every community deserves safety, respect, and a fair chance to thrive.",

    quote7:
      "We need a clear plan to use our current local funding more effectively while also identifying why federal funding is critical for real reform. For example, if our goal is to help more renters become homeowners, then federal policies must change. Too many families are trapped in long-term renting because of how federal programs are structured.{newParagraph}True equity comes when families can build generational wealth through homeownership, not when they are locked into renting. Once residents understand this reasoning, we can rally them to push for changes in the federal funding structure.",

    quote1:
      "In my eight years leading this city, we have faced one unprecedented challenge after the next — from COVID-19, to the murder of George Floyd, to civil unrest, a rock slide, a cyberattack, and now new Trump-era uncertainty. Each crisis tested our resolve, but through it all we’ve not only learned how to better support each other in tough times — but how to come out of those times stronger.{newParagraph}We’ve reduced violent crime through our nationally recognized Community-First Public Safety model, which centers prevention, partnership, and care. We’ve invested in mental health responders, youth outreach workers, and neighborhood safety teams — and the results are clear: Saint Paul is safer today because of this work. At the same time, we’ve built real momentum across every corner of our city. We’ve made historic investments in families and neighborhoods — raising the minimum wage, eliminating library late fines, and making youth sports free.{newParagraph}We launched CollegeBound Saint Paul, giving every newborn a college savings account, and created one of the first city-led guaranteed income pilots in the nation. We’ve built more affordable housing than ever before, launched new renter protections, and forgiven medical debt owed by low-income residents. We’ve doubled our pace to rebuild arterial streets in our city, we’re improving our parks faster than ever, and we’ve set about the enormous task of replacing lead water lines across our city — at no cost to families.{newParagraph}We’ve come a long way — and we’re not done. That’s why I’m running for re-election: because I believe in this moment, and I believe that there’s so much more we can build — together. We’re set up well for this next phase. That means making our public spaces more accessible, helping people get connected to care, and contributing to hold accountable those who choose to break our social contract. It means seizing our opportunities to grow — cutting red tape, attracting new investments, and making sure the world knows what we know: Saint Paul is one of the best places anywhere to build a family, a business, and a home. Together, we’ve built real momentum — and I’m ready to keep it going alongside you.",
    quote2:
      "As mayor, I have championed Saint Paul’s identity as a welcoming and inclusive city, prioritizing policies that uplift immigrants and communities of color. I have advanced equity-driven initiatives, which invest directly in families, and supported affordable housing, workforce development, and small business growth in culturally diverse neighborhoods. Under my leadership, Saint Paul has strengthened language access, promoted sanctuary policies to ensure residents feel safe seeking services, and invested in community partnerships to close racial disparities.{newParagraph}My administration emphasizes representation, regularly engaging immigrant and BIPOC leaders to guide decision-making, while celebrating cultural diversity as a central strength of our city’s future.",
    quote3:
      "We are hard at work bringing downtown back to life. We are doing it by converting vacant buildings into housing, launching new festivals and events, and working with small businesses to help them grow. Today, Saint Paul is hosting more major events than ever before — from the Yacht Club music festival to the World Juniors hockey tournament — while attracting new development interest from national investors. Now it’s time to accelerate that growth — and make our downtown a place that generates wealth for our communities, while being a neighborhood people are proud to call home.",
    quote4:
      "Our response to the recent cyberattack demonstrates the resilience of our city staff and their absolute commitment to our public safety. Thanks to swift action from staff, close coordination with state and federal law enforcement resources, and rapid support from the Minnesota National Guard’s Cyber Protection Team, we contained the threat, safeguarded critical systems, restored essential services quickly, and ensured that city employees made payroll. This response reflects not only our city’s preparation, but also the strength of the state and federal partnerships that protect our residents.{newParagraph}Looking forward, we are investing in stronger cyber defenses, from system upgrades to staff training. However, cybersecurity is not just a government issue, it’s a shared responsibility. Every municipality, business, and individual has a role to play in safeguarding their data and staying vigilant against threats that are increasingly sophisticated and widespread. By working together to adopt best practices and invest in prevention, we can make [sure] we are all resilient in the face of these increasing threats.",
    quote5:
      "To revitalize the Snelling and University Midway corridor we have a comprehensive strategy that combines public safety and maintenance improvements with strong economic and community investments. This includes cleaning up and activating vacant spaces, strengthening code enforcement, and improving lighting, sidewalks, and transit connections to create a safer, more inviting environment.{newParagraph}We need to continue getting creative about partnering with neighborhood organizations and cultural leaders to host events, add public art, and shape development plans to ensure the corridor uplifts its diverse communities. By reducing vacancies, attracting businesses, and increasing foot traffic, while leveraging city, state, and private resources, this area of our city can be a vibrant, inclusive community for residents.",
    quote6:
      "I absolutely support our city ordinance that limits city employees from asking about immigration status and prohibits use of city resources to assist with enforcement actions. I have proudly joined lawsuits challenging attempts by the Trump administration to withhold federal funds as punishment for not cooperating with immigration enforcement requests. Under my leadership St. Paul will not be commandeered by federal immigration policy. St. Paul has never made immigration status a condition for accessing city services and it is my absolute promise to you to keep it that way.",
    quote7:
      "In the immediate term, the city can strengthen partnerships with the State to secure targeted aid, particularly in housing, public safety, and workforce development where state funds can substitute for lost federal streams. The mayor can also pursue competitive state and philanthropic grants, while leveraging federal dollars that remain.{newParagraph}Longer-term, Saint Paul needs to expand its tax base by encouraging mixed-use redevelopment in corridors like Midway, growing our housing stock, and attracting new businesses that generate property and sales tax revenues. Together, these strategies help buffer against federal cuts while advancing a more resilient, inclusive city economy.",

I consider myself an urbanist and I do not think any of the other candidates fully understand what it takes to build a great city. I also think we need a mayor who is focused on actually doing the job of running the city rather than just trying to be a figurehead for policy decisions that are up to the city council to enact, not the mayor.",
    quote2:
      "Just listening to and acting in accordance to the suggestions of advocates within those communities is the best way to advocate for them. In order to build a city that benefits all of us, we need to take input from everyone and have a conversation about how we can address any issues within the constraints of city government. A lot of policies that are desperately needed need to be advocated for at the state level and to the city council directly.{newParagraph}As mayor, if I hear anything that the city council or state is not taking into account I will absolutely push them on it and direct people's momentum towards the ones who can affect the change they need.",
    quote3:
      "Downtown has been in need of revitalization ever since they carved a freeway directly through it decades ago and giving handouts to private property owners isn't going to fix it. If you want a thriving downtown it has to be a place people actually want to spend time in, not just a place to drive to for an event and then drive away. Pedestrianizing every road that we physically can, legalizing street vendors in areas that have no street level businesses, and renovating vacant buildings into housing or other uses are just a few ways to improve downtown.{newParagraph}Unfortunately, a lot of these solutions are under the power of city council to enact and not the mayor, but I will absolutely advocate for anything that benefits the public.",

These are privately owned properties surrounded by state and county owned roads (I-94, Snelling, University, and Lexington).{newParagraph}I am strongly in favor of land value tax to incentivize owners of large parking lots to redevelop them, actually re-thinking I-94 to reduce the pollution and high speed traffic, and even the city council using eminent domain to force out bad land uses and give the city the opportunity to create public housing, public markets, and more. We need to be honest about who holds the power to make these changes and not solely rely on the mayor's soft power influence as a means to an end.",
