      "I'm running for mayor because I believe Minneapolis is heading in the wrong direction. If we’re not careful, we’ll end up like Detroit, where working-class families were pushed out of their homes, and low-income families became the next unhoused neighbors. With my background and experience, I believe I can help stop that from happening and lead real change to turn this city around.",
    quote2:
      "Yes. I will continue to advocate for those who feel unheard. I stand for them, and I stand with them. Their safety, dignity, and right to exist freely in our city is not just their fight; it's our collective fight. These are our rights being violated, and I refuse to stay silent.{newParagraph}We are all immigrants in one way or another. Our stories, roots, and struggles may look different, but our humanity is the same. In that shared humanity, we find our strength.{newParagraph}It’s time to rise together, protect one another, and build a city where no one is left behind. I am not backing down, and I won't let anyone be pushed aside.",
    quote3:
      "Our city should not have to deal with encampments at all. We have new apartment buildings going up every other week, yet many of them sit empty. Why aren’t we talking about the real issue of homelessness? For years now, the Minnesota government has allowed busloads of unhoused individuals from other states to come here places like New York and New Orleans. While we should absolutely take care of our own residents in need, we can’t fix this crisis if other states continue sending their unhoused populations here. Minneapolis cannot solve this problem alone. It’s time we put pressure on those states to stop shifting their responsibilities onto us.",
    quote4:
      "No, I believe that if the Mayor and Police Chief knew what was happening, they should have informed the City Council at the very least, the council member representing the ward where the incident occurred. The city should have also sent out an alert to notify residents in the area to stay put, as authorities were actively searching for someone. The alert should have clearly stated: For your safety, please remain where you are if possible.",
    quote5:
      "I do not believe the Minneapolis Police Department can simply be reformed — we are far beyond that point. What we need now is a mayor who is ready to rebuild the department from the ground up, with peace officers who are truly committed to building real relationships with the people who live and work in this city. Rebuilding trust and mutual respect between the community and law enforcement must be our priority. That’s how we move forward — together.",

We deserve leadership that will meet the urgency of our climate crisis. We deserve an interconnected and multigenerational city with a vibrant, worker-centered economy and thriving public schools.{newParagraph}I'm running for mayor because Minneapolis is at a moral moment right now. We can either continue down this same path for another four years, or we can make a change.{newParagraph}We have everything we need to solve our most pressing problems as a city – but gridlock and division are making it impossible for our city to get things done. Our current mayor has awarded jobs and contracts based on personal loyalty rather than qualifications. The antagonism between the Mayor and the City Council has created dysfunction, which negatively impacts everyone who lives here.{newParagraph}Under the threat of the Trump administration, it’s more important than ever that our city government can work together. I’m running because we deserve a mayor who can build consensus and trust out of division, one who will govern with integrity. I believe in us – and I know that with the right leadership, we can build the city we deserve together.",

      "Our city’s immigrant neighbors and communities of color deserve a mayor who will center the needs, joys, and successes of their communities, who will invest in their homes, neighborhoods, and businesses, and who will make sure they have the safety and stability they need to thrive. Our communities deserve leadership that will show up in their neighborhoods consistently to support them, not just to curry votes.{newParagraph}Our communities of color and immigrants need safe, stable, and affordable housing. They need protection from state violence from the Trump administration. They need a community safety ecosystem that is focused on responding to their needs and keeping them safe. They need principled leadership that will advocate for them across all forms of government.{newParagraph}From co-chairing the Minnesota Poor People’s Campaign to working with the County to bring HIV care to Black and Brown communities, I’ve spent years building relationships with communities of color and with immigrant communities across the city. I will bring those relationships and that trust into the Mayor’s Office. This isn’t theoretical for me – I’m talking about the neighborhood that my husband and I live in and the people we call neighbors and friends. I will continue to work with the people I’ve stood shoulder to shoulder with in the past 12 years, and I’ll continue to build relationships with those I haven’t worked with yet to advocate for our communities.",

      "The encampments popping up in our city are a reflection of our failure to adequately care for our neighbors. We should be working to prevent and depopulate encampments as quickly as possible by offering support and services, not with bulldozers and police.{newParagraph}Mayor Frey’s go-it-alone approach has left us isolated from important partners in this work. As Mayor, I will build on the relationships I have with the County, the State, and non-profits to coordinate a humane response to this crisis. We need more shelter beds and safe and community-led alternatives to shelter. We also need to support non-profit and public developers in building significantly more deeply affordable housing. With me as Mayor, Minneapolis will be a trusted leader in coordinating and growing the supports and services our unhoused neighbors need.{newParagraph}My administration will work tirelessly to do better by our unhoused neighbors and to offer better, safer options. In a city as prosperous as ours, there’s no reason why anyone’s best option should be sleeping outside. There shouldn’t be encampments in our city because our unhoused neighbors deserve better.",
    quote4:
      "Mayor Frey handled the raid poorly. Even though he was aware of the raid before it happened, he didn’t immediately tell the City Council, leading to significant confusion. He accepted wholesale the explanation for the raid that the Trump administration offered, even as they have consistently lied and deceived to advance their campaign against immigrants. And afterward, he and his team seemed more interested in telling the city how well they handled the situation and blaming our neighbors who showed up to ask questions for causing confusion. The truth is that our mayor has lost the trust of much of our community, and that lack of trust exacerbated an already tense situation.{newParagraph}Minneapolis deserves a mayor who will be transparent with us about federal activity in our city and will work together with our city council in times of crisis. We deserve a mayor who will push his administration, including the police department, to demand transparency from federal agencies and not just accept their explanations for their actions in our city. We deserve a mayor who our neighbors can trust, who will show up in a crisis to offer support and leadership. And we deserve a mayor who will recognize that accountability is a necessary part of leadership, will acknowledge what has gone wrong, and will be proactive in challenging the Trump administration’s actions.{newParagraph}The people of our city have shown time and time again our capacity to care for our immigrant neighbors and our commitment to keeping them safe. Now we need leadership that reflects those values.",
    quote5:
      "Our city deserves a police department that is both responsive to the diverse needs of our neighbors and is fully accountable to them. The investigations done by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights showed what our neighbors had been telling us for years: that there is a pervasive culture of bias and discrimination in our police department.{newParagraph}The federal consent decree required important and necessary reforms for our police department, and it’s important that our city doesn’t put those reforms aside just because the federal government has. We should integrate any reforms in the abandoned federal consent decree into the state agreement so that our city and our police department have formal and legal accountability to enact them. The Mayor’s Office has made this process seem impossible, but legal experts and the Department of Human Rights say that it’s a straightforward process. As Mayor, I’ll get it done.",

Ours is a city with an abundance of generosity, ingenuity, and care. But we need principled, collaborative leadership to bring together everything our city has to offer, especially in the face of this hostile administration.{newParagraph}We need an all-hands-on-deck approach to these funding cuts. We need to deepen our relationships with the County and the State to imagine how we can come together to support our neighbors. We need to create a culture within city government that invites in and celebrates experts, leaders, and innovators to work with our communities in new ways.

I will work alongside the community to lead this discussion, and I remain committed to creating the spaces needed to have these robust discussions.{newParagraph}As the proud son of Somali immigrants, fighting for immigrant rights has always been the center of my work and mission. As a state senator, I have worked closely with immigrant rights groups and organizations and within my own East African community to author and pass legislation to support and protect immigrants in our state. In particular, I am proud to have authored the Minnesota Northstar Act, which would prohibit local and state law enforcement from using state resources to deport our neighbors. In addition, in my position as the chair of Higher Education, I am worked with students and administrators at the University of Minnesota to make sure that there is no collaboration with ICE and to resist any deportations or civil immigration enforcement on university and college campuses. Everyone in our state deserves to feel safe and welcomed. {newParagraph}As Mayor, I will continue this work by strengthening, upholding and expanding our Minneapolis separation ordinance, and ensuring that no City resources are used to collaborate with ICE. I will also continue to work closely with immigrant rights groups like Unidos MN, COPAL, CTUL and more to inform how the mayor’s office can best direct support immigrants in our city.

We must embrace a Housing First approach — housing ends homelessness; whenever possible, people should be connected directly to housing.",

Regardless of what anyone says about what took place on June 3rd, having been on the ground witnessing events unfold with my own eyes, I know that ICE was present and I saw MPD assist with their actions. This should have never happened, and as Mayor, I would work to strengthen our separation ordinance to make sure it can never happen again and I would hold officers that violate our separation ordinance accountable for their actions.{newParagraph}As a hostile Trump administration attacks our communities, local accountability is more important than ever. I am running for Mayor to work towards a city where everyone feels safe and protected. That means standing with our immigrant and undocumented neighbors against attacks from the Federal Government. Our communities deserve reassurance that MPD will not collaborate with ICE and other federal agencies that are intending to strike fear in the hearts of our most marginalized neighbors.{newParagraph}Given that we now know that MPD did not violate Minneapolis' current separation ordinance on June 3rd, I am committed to strengthening this policy in order to ensure we are protecting all our neighbors and pushing back against a hostile federal government.",

Once elected, I will implement the numerous existing reforms that our current Mayor has refused to attempt, including the actions outlined in both consent decrees as well as funding for public safety solutions that supplement traditional policing. While the Trump administration has abandoned the federal consent decree, the plan that was laid out by it is still actionable and should be implemented.{newParagraph}As Mayor, I will implement the reforms outlined in the State and Federal Consent Decrees without hesitation, and will ensure that there is sufficient funding and accountability to enforce every part of both consent decrees.",

      "The federal action on Lake Street brought trauma and fear to a portion of our city. Minneapolis must be better prepared and more transparent in situations like this. We need to be aware in advance when large armored vehicles are coming into our city, and there must be faster communication directly to city leaders, especially those in the neighborhoods most impacted.{newParagraph}Our officers must be deployed to chaotic and unsafe scenes with their boots pointed in the correct direction and in line with our separation ordinance, which I believe should be expanded. When there is a drug or other criminal investigation that does not involve immigration enforcement, we should of course work in partnership with federal agencies. But that partnership must be focused only on the criminal cases, not on immigration enforcement or other activities that erode trust with our communities.",
    quote5:
      "Yes, I support the policing reforms outlined in the proposed federal consent decree. The fact that the decree was abandoned does not erase the need for those reforms. Minneapolis is now in a position where the state of Minnesota has entered into an agreement with the city, while the federal government has stepped back. This creates a gap between state-level oversight and what the Department of Justice originally sought, and that gap must be bridged if we are going to restore trust and accountability.{newParagraph}As mayor, I will work with the City Council to return to court and update our state-level agreement so that it reflects the necessary changes that align with the spirit of the federal reforms. I will also push for coordination between state and federal partners so that our city is not left with fragmented or inconsistent accountability. At the same time, I will ensure reforms such as improved use-of-force policies, expanded mental health response, stronger civilian oversight, and transparent discipline are fully implemented.{newParagraph}We must set clear benchmarks, publish progress through a public dashboard, and hold leadership accountable for meeting the expectations of both residents and government at every level.",
    quote6:
      "To make up for lost federal grants, Minneapolis must start by protecting essentials. Public safety, housing stability, and core city services will remain the top priorities.

That includes pursuing all available federal and state grants, fixing application delays, and working with regional and nonprofit partners so Minneapolis never leaves money on the table.{newParagraph}We also need to grow our local tax base by making it easier for small businesses to thrive. Faster permitting, revitalizing commercial corridors, and expanding access for local firms to win city contracts will help create more jobs and long-term revenue without raising tax rates.{newParagraph}Another important step is reviewing cost-recovery tools to make sure fees reflect actual service costs, while still protecting low-income households. In addition, we can save millions by cutting waste, reducing overtime with smarter staffing, consolidating duplicative contracts, and digitizing services. And by investing in energy efficiency and infrastructure upgrades in city facilities, we can lower ongoing utility and maintenance costs, freeing up more resources for housing, safety, and neighborhood services.{newParagraph}These are some of the ways we can close the gap, protect critical services, and build a stronger, more resilient city budget.",

      "Over the last five years, Minneapolis was tested as never before. American cities have faced some of the toughest challenges that we’ve had to confront in generations. But where other cities across the country have struggled and stagnated, Minneapolis has been making a comeback. The challenges we’re facing have not gone away, but our progress is improving people’s lives.{newParagraph}On housing, Minneapolis is leading the nation. While the rest of the country saw rent increase by 31% since 2017. In Minneapolis, we held that increase to just 1%. Now, Minneapolis is producing 8.5 times more deeply affordable housing than before I took office. We also made unprecedented investments in affordable homeownership. And our Stable Homes Stable Schools program has provided stable housing to about 6,000 MPS kids across over 2,000 families.{newParagraph}We’re also making progress on public safety. Police recruitment is up 135%, MPD has more officers today than it has had in years, and the department is the most diverse in our city’s history. And, violent crime is down – in fact, in North Minneapolis, shootings are lower than they’ve been in over 15 years. {newParagraph}Meanwhile, we’re moving forward on police reform. The independent, court-appointed monitor for our consent decree credited Minneapolis with making “more progress toward building a foundation for sustainable reform in the first year of monitoring than nearly any other jurisdiction” in the nation.{newParagraph}Now, I’m running for one more term to bring Minneapolis through to its next brilliant chapter. Let’s do that by building more affordable housing, hiring more police officers to bring down violent crime, accelerating our climate action goals, and delivering exemplary core city services for Minneapolis.",

      "Through ordinance and executive action, Minneapolis has enshrined our commitment to immigrant communities, and I will continue standing up against Donald Trump and his harmful policies. MPD does not and will not cooperate with ICE or any federal agency in immigration enforcement. I will not compromise our city’s values in protecting our undocumented community, even if we are threatened with a withholding of federal funds. We are proactively suing Donald Trump and his administration, working in conjunction with cities, states, and attorneys general from around the country, and we will not back down.{newParagraph}Our Office of Immigrant & Refugee Affairs helps coordinate services and legal protections for our immigrant communities, and we have developed a taskforce of important stakeholders to get input and disseminate important information. We connect immigrant entrepreneurs to business support and technical assistance to bolster their work and keep cultural corridors strong.{newParagraph}Finally, I will also support any additional actions that we can take to supplement our separation ordinance and prevent city employees from being involved in immigration enforcement (including but not limited to ICE) and to protect our immigrant neighbors.",

We are producing 8.5 times the amount of deeply affordable housing since before I took office, without which we would have no ability to place people coming out of homelessness. {newParagraph}We are also one of the only major cities in the country to reduce unsheltered homelessness since the pandemic. In Minneapolis, unsheltered homelessness is down 33% since 2020. Through our Homeless Response Team, we’ve helped more than 270 people transition into stable housing and services just in the last few months — and we’ve seen 911 and 311 calls in neighborhoods that previously had large encampments drop by nearly 80%. Currently, we have no medium or large-scale encampments in Minneapolis.{newParagraph}We have to lead with compassion and outreach, offering to connect people living in encampments with housing, addiction treatment, and other social services -- and we will continue to learn and improve how we conduct that outreach and deliver those services. But the truth is that encampments are neither safe nor humane for those who live in them or around them. We have to be willing to close encampments down that have become unsafe, especially when they become targets for human traffickers, violence, and drug traffickers.",

      'Yes, but you don’t have to take my word for it. The city auditor, who does not report to the mayor’s office or to my administration, confirmed that our police department did not violate our separation ordinance. That’s why I was so disappointed when all of my opponents pledged to fire or discipline Chief O’Hara. The audit report confirmed that Lake & Bloomington wasn’t an immigration raid at all, and that MPD was not even aware of the operation, let alone involved in executing it.{newParagraph}My leading opponent went on national TV and claimed that our police department broke the law and that I myself ""had MPD collaborate with ICE in targeting our immigrant communities.” In a crisis, mayors have a responsibility to share accurate information, not stoke panic on social media for political gain. There are certainly things we can improve should we face a true immigration raid. But firing or disciplining Chief O’Hara is not the answer.',

The independent monitor for our consent decree recently credited Minneapolis with making “more progress toward building a foundation for sustainable reform in the first year of monitoring than nearly any other jurisdiction” in the nation. I plan to see that roadmap through during my final term. We have invested tens of millions of dollars, built a foundation for true change, and we will see through to fruition every paragraph of every page of the agreements that we signed onto.{newParagraph}For years, people have talked about building a police department that is reflective of the community. We are doing it, with the most diverse police department in our city’s history. For years, people have talked about building a comprehensive public safety system, including a system well beyond that of police officers alone. We are doing it. The city is now providing 24/7 mental health response, violence prevention services, and we created the Office of Community Safety.{newParagraph}Finally, we also just launched a mobile medical unit to provide health services to underserved communities. I look forward to building on and refining these reforms in the years to come.",

      "First, we are taking action to fight these cuts in court -- and so far, we’re winning. In coordination with other jurisdictions, we sued the Trump administration and have won key victories. But we also have to be prepared for the worst, especially with the shift toward work from home and the impact that is having on the property tax base in downtowns in major cities.{newParagraph}For the 2026 budget, a 13% percent property tax hike would have been necessary to maintain current spending levels in Minneapolis -- an unacceptable outcome for homeowners and renters across our city. We were able to cut that down to 7.8% (a 40% reduction) by identifying millions in saving and cutting back on non-essential programs so that we could avoid layoffs while preserving core services like housing, police, trash, and streets.",

      "The Socialist Workers Party campaign is the only campaign with a program for the vast majority – the working class. Capitalism is the source of the economic, social and moral crises faced by working people worldwide, including in Minneapolis, which includes the drive toward another world war. The SWP campaign opposes Jew-hatred and supports Israel’s right to exist. Only a movement of workers to take power out of the hands of the capitalist class can begin to solve these crises in the interest of our class.",

Unemployment and other social ills bred by capitalism always hits Blacks, Native Americans, and other oppressed harder. The Socialist Workers Party candidates call for a massive public works program to provide employment at union-scale wages building housing, schools, roads and other needed infrastructure, including building and staffing childcare centers to ease the burdens on working-class families, especially women.{newParagraph}Working class families need a supplement to their income, an income sufficient for workers to maintain steady employment, as the labor movement fights for universal childcare and medical care.",
    quote3:
      "Frederick Engels, in his book “The Housing Question,” said “In order to put an end to the housing shortage there is only one means: to abolish altogether the exploitation and oppression of the working class by the ruling class.” While various initiatives find some housing for some people, the capitalist system continuously recreates the crisis anew.  The Socialist Workers Party candidates call for a massive public works program to provide employment at union-scale wages building housing. But we need more. We need to build a proletarian party to lead our class to take power out of the hands of the capitalist class before their drive for profit ends in a new world war. That is the only way “to abolish altogether the exploitation and oppression of the working class by the ruling class.”",
    quote4:
      "The Socialist Workers Party opposes all attacks on democratic rights.  Whether a militarized and heavily armed attempt to serve warrants at a restaurant on Lake Street or at the home of a former president at Mar-a-Largo. The SWP is opposed to the use of national guard and federal troops in cities across the country, as well as the increased use of all federal cop agencies under the guise of “fighting crime.”  The ultimate target is the working class and the growing resistance to the attacks by the bosses.",
    quote5:
      'Decades of police "reform" have not resulted in any meaningful change.  The role of the cops is the same -- to protect the property and privileges of the ruling capitalist class.  That role becomes sharper in times of increased class struggle. We are for the prosecution of cops who brutalize or kill working people. Because of the social ills bred by capitalism, including crime in working class communities, it is not possible to do away with the police. In Cuba it took a proletarian revolution of millions to change the system and replace the old regime\'s brutal police force with one that serves the interest of the working class.',
